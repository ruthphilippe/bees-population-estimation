# üêù Bee Population Estimation with Machine Learning

This project uses bee observation data (GBIF) to build a machine learning model that predicts **bee individual counts** based on location, taxonomy, and time features.

## üöÄ How It Works
- Preprocessing: scaling + one-hot encoding + imputing missing values
- Model: RandomForestRegressor
- Evaluation: RMSE & R¬≤
- Feature importance to see which features matter most

## üìÇ Project Structure
- `bees_population_estimation.ipynb` ‚Üí full notebook
- `requirements.txt` ‚Üí dependencies

## üõ† Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/bees-population-estimation.git
cd bees-population-estimation
pip install -r requirements.txt
